  <p>I am currently working as a Team Manager for an outsourcing company which is <a href="https://www.boltonremote.com/">Bolton International</a>, and is supporting a <a href="https://haveninc.com/">Singapore-based shipping/logistics company</a> for almost three years. I am responsible for managing an offshore team with 20
    agents, training, coaching and supporting them, making sure that service standards are met. I also have experience of quality monitoring, assessing outcomes and devising
    new systems of work to improve efficiency. Before that, I worked as a Team Leader for different Australian-based logistics/shipping companies for a total of two years. I was also a Team Leader in a <a href="https://www.concentrix.com/">contact cente</a> for two years specializing in
    customer service for a <a href="https://www.att.com/">US-based telecommunications company</a>. Before becoming a Team Leader for the same company, I was first a Customer Service Representative for a total of four years. Aside from that, I am also currently pursuing a career in web
    development and is learning French language at the same time. I know how to write stenography. I ❤️ cycling and watching South Korean dramas.</p>
